True Jamaica: Technical Architecture & Roadmap 🇯🇲1. Information ArchitectureThe platform connects Supply (Hosts) with Demand (Travelers) through a Story-First interface.Core Data Models (Firebase Schema)users (Collection)uid (string): Firebase Auth IDrole (string): 'traveler' | 'host' | 'admin'email (string)whatsapp (string): For contactexperiences (Collection)id (string): Auto-generatedhost_id (string): Reference to userstitle (string): "Maroon Drumming"category (string): 'culture' | 'farm' | 'nature'description (string): Full texthost_story (string): Critical for authenticitycultural_significance (string): Critical for missionprice_usd (number)location (geopoint): { lat, lng }location_fuzzy (string): "Accompong Town" (Public view)images (array): URLsactivity_level (string): 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'is_active (boolean)inquiries (Collection)id (string)experience_id (string)traveler_id (string)status (string): 'pending' | 'approved' | 'declined'message (string)dates (array)2. Backend Setup (Firebase)Do this when ready to go live.Create Project: Go to console.firebase.google.com -> "True Jamaica".Auth: Enable "Google" and "Email/Password".Firestore: Create database in nam5 (US Central) region.Storage: Enable for Host Photo uploads.Security Rules:Read: Allow public read for experiences.Write: Only allow authenticated users with role == 'host' to create/edit their own listings.3. QA & Edge Cases (The "Gotchas")ScenarioSolutionHost has no emailUse SMS Auth (Firebase Phone Auth) in Phase 2. For now, rely on WhatsApp for coordination.Location SecrecyStore precise coordinates in DB, but front-end only renders a generic "Circle" on the map until booking is confirmed.Over-tourismImplement "Quota" system. If a listing gets >50 inquiries/month, auto-hide it to protect the community.Low BandwidthUse next/image or Cloudinary for aggressive image compression. Offline mode (PWA) is essential.4. Monetization Strategy (Future)V1 (Current): Free. Focus on growth and trust.V2 (Partnerships): Charge "Premium" listing fees to larger Eco-Lodges to subsidize free listings for small farmers.V3 (Commission): 10% fee on bookings (Requires Stripe integration).
