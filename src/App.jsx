You are a senior full-stack product team building an MVP web platform from scratch.
Act as: product manager, UX researcher, frontend engineer, backend engineer, database architect, and QA tester.
Assume the user has ZERO coding experience.
Explain everything step-by-step and generate production-ready code.

🌍 PLATFORM VISION

Build a platform called (working name: “True Jamaica” – can be changed later).

The goal is to connect tourists seeking real Jamaican experiences with overlooked, under-the-radar local artisans, guides, farmers, cultural keepers, and eco-hosts.

This platform must prioritize:

Authenticity over mass tourism

Education, storytelling, and cultural respect

Local economic empowerment

Hard-to-find experiences not listed on TripAdvisor or resort desks

🎯 CORE USERS

Local Hosts

Artisans (wood carving, pottery, jewelry, textiles)

Farmers (coffee, cocoa, herbs, food)

Cultural keepers (Maroon communities, Rastafarian elders, storytellers)

Nature guides (caves, rivers, hiking, birding)

Home cooks & village food vendors

Travelers

Eco-tourists

Cultural travelers

Diaspora visitors

Creatives, students, families

People who explicitly want “non-touristy” experiences

🧩 EXPERIENCE TYPES TO SUPPORT (MUST BE FIRST-CLASS FEATURES)

Each listing can be tagged with one or more:

🌿 Hidden nature experiences (rivers, caves, mineral springs, farms)

🎨 Artisan workshops (make-your-own craft, learn the story)

🍲 Home cooking & village food experiences

🪘 Cultural immersion (Maroon, Rasta, drumming, oral history)

☕ Coffee, cocoa, farming, and land-based learning

🧭 Story-led village walking tours

🌊 Coastal fishing village life & sea experiences

🏗️ MVP FEATURES (REQUIRED)
For Travelers

Browse experiences by Region, Category, Level of Physical Activity

Map view with pins (simple)

Experience detail page:

Host story

Cultural significance

What you’ll learn

What’s included

Price

Duration

Group size

Booking request (no instant booking initially)

WhatsApp / email contact integration

Save / favorite experiences

For Hosts

Simple host onboarding (non-technical friendly)

Create an experience listing with:

Photos

Story (guided prompts)

Location (approximate, not exact for safety)

Availability

Price

Dashboard to view inquiries

No payment processing in v1 (inquiry-based MVP)

🧠 IMPORTANT DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Mobile-first

Low-bandwidth friendly

Clean, earthy aesthetic (greens, browns, off-white)

Story-driven UI, not salesy

Respectful language (no “exotic”, no exploitation)

🧑🏾‍💻 TECH REQUIREMENTS (KEEP IT SIMPLE)

Frontend: React (or Next.js if you recommend)

Backend: Firebase or Supabase

Auth: Email + Google

Database: Structured but flexible (hosts, experiences, categories)

Hosting: Vercel or Firebase Hosting

Map: Google Maps or Mapbox (basic pins only)

🪜 STEP-BY-STEP OUTPUT REQUIRED

You must:

Propose the information architecture

Design the data models

Generate full frontend code

Generate backend setup

Walk through deployment click-by-click

Include a sample dataset of Jamaican experiences

Explain how a non-coder updates content

Flag future monetization options (but don’t implement yet)

🧪 QA & EDGE CASES

What if host has no email?

What if location must remain secret until booking?

How to prevent over-tourism?

How to spotlight lesser-known parishes?

🚀 GOAL

Deliver a working MVP that:

Can be shared with real Jamaican hosts

Can be shown to investors or partners

Can evolve into a mobile app later

Start by outlining the product architecture, then proceed step by step.
Do NOT skip steps.
Assume I know nothing and guide me like a mentor.

🧠 OPTIONAL: VIBE-CODING BOOSTER (ADD THIS IF YOU WANT EXTRA DETAIL)

When generating code, explain:

What each file does

Where to paste it

What buttons to click

What mistakes beginners usually make

🧩 WHAT THIS SETS YOU UP FOR

NGO partnerships

Diaspora travel programs

Ethical tourism grants

Community-owned marketplaces

Future features like tipping, reviews, or donations
